Kernel build is based on:
https://github.com/archlinux/svntogit-packages/tree/packages/linux-zen/trunk @2783670

# NOTES

Listing content of built initramfs:

    cpio -civt < out/build/initramfs/initramfs
    zcat out/build/initramfs.gz | cpio -civt

initramfs contains toybox binary, symlinked as /bin/sh
(Downloaded from https://landley.net/toybox/bin/)

You can add `rdinit=/bin/sh` to kernel cmdline (in qemu.sh) to boot to shell.
Then run the following oneliner to get all shell commands working:

    cd /bin; for i in $(./toybox); do ./toybox ln -s toybox $i; done
